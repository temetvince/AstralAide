# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.

astralaide.com {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	root * /srv/astral-aide

	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
	reverse_proxy localhost:4430
}

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
